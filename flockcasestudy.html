<!--Intro-->
    <h3 class="flock-body-headers">The fantasy</h3>
    <p class="flock-body-p">No one likes to think a group trip will ever go poorly. Whether it’s a girls’ get-away, a college buddy reunite, or family road trip, everyone starts out with the best intentions and excitement about the memories to come. Late night conversations, thrilling adventures and group bonding are what’s on the mind. <br> <br>But when you get down to it, planning a group trip isn’t easy.</p>
    <h3 class="flock-body-headers">The reality (a.k.a the problem)</h3>
    <p class="flock-body-p">Multiple schedules, different personalities and preferences for activities can lead to stress, frustration, and occasionally, a trip getting called off— which strains finances and friendships. We knew their had to be a better way.</p>
    <h3 class="flock-body-headers">The road to a solution</h3>
    <img src="Images/flock/my-process.png" alt="The series of steps in my process with little icons to go along with each. 1. Discover & Empathize. 2. Define & Ideate. 3. Prototype 4. Test" class="my-process-img">

    <!--The start of where I explain my process-->  
<!--1. Discovery & empathizing-->  
    <h3>1. Discovery & empathizing</h3>
    <h4 class="subheading-beneath-process-stage">User Research</h4>
    <p class="flock-body-p">I started out by investigating what people’s travel planning process like. What do they love? Hate? Wish was different? <br> <br> Myself and my collaborator, Edward Chase, interviewed and surveyed <b>22 people</b> who traveled at least twice a year across the age spectrum from 18 to 50+. A few patterns emerged: </p>
    <img src="Images/flock/trip negatives.png" alt="" id="trip-negatives" class="flock-body-images">
    <p class="flock-body-p">It turns out that the people on your trip can be the best thing about it or the worst. Trip planners often felt that gaining a consensus on big trip decisions, like trip dates or daily itineraries, could be particularly difficult. </p>
    <img src="Images/flock/Alexandra quote.png" alt="" id="alexandra-quote" class="flock-body-images">
    <h4 class="subheading-beneath-process-stage">Meet Rachel!</h4>
    <p class="flock-body-p">To encapsulate everything we were hearing from users and to give me someone to picture when I was designing, we created a proto-persona named Rachel. She’s 26, loves adventuring and hopes to meet up with her friends on a trip soon.</p>
    <img src="Images/flock/Rachel persona.png" alt="" id="rachel-persona" id="rachel-persona">

<!--2. Definition & ideation-->  
    <h3>2. Definition & ideation</h3>
    <p class="flock-body-p">I went on to distill users’ pain points into a user insight statement through the point of view of Rachel.</p>

<!--User insight statement & how might we-->  
    <h4 class="subheading-beneath-process-stage">User insight statement & how might we question</h4>
    <p class="flock-body-p">Rachel likes to travel with friends, but often finds it difficult to plan and complete a trip with more than three people. <br> <br> It frustrates her that most of her friends do not care about planning the trip, because she is the one to blame if anything goes wrong and it takes me a lot of time. She wishes there were a way to get more people involved in planning the trip and for them to better communicate when they get there.</p>
    <img src="Images/flock/How-might-we-question.png" alt="How might we develop a way for a young traveler to better communicate with trip members while planning their trip?" id="how-might-we-img">
    <p class="flock-body-p">Using that question as a guidepost, I started brainstorming solutions based on what our users said.</p>

<!--feature prioritzation matrix-->  
    <h4 class="subheading-beneath-process-stage">Feature prioritization matrix</h4>
    <p class="flock-body-p">My first step was creating a feature prioritization matrix that showed what areas people cared the most about.</p>
    <img src="Images/flock/feature prioritization matrix.png" alt="an x and y axis graph with priority on the y axis and impact on the x axis. Sticky note images with notes from interviewees are arranged along different points." class="flock-body-images">

<!--value prop matrix-->  
    <h4 class="subheading-beneath-process-stage">Value proposition matrix</h4>
    <p class="flock-body-p">My first step was creating a feature prioritization matrix that showed what areas people cared the most about.</p>
    <img src="Images/flock/Value prop.png" alt="a chart depicting a square and a circle. Within the circle are the gains and jobs that the ideal user would have. In the square is the gain creators and pain relievers as well as services and products the user would like." class="my-process-img">

<!--user scenario, storyboard and journey map-->  
    <h4 class="subheading-beneath-process-stage">User scenario, storyboard and journey map</h4>
    <p class="flock-body-p">I imagined how Rachel (or any user) could actually use these features in real life.</p>
    <img src="Images/flock/user storyboard.png" alt="a storyboard image of the proto-persona visiting a friend in San Francisco and how Flock helps her make her trip easier." id="storyboard-img-flock">

    <img src="Images/flock/user journey map.png" alt="This journey map shows the users highs and lows throughout the trip planning process." id="journey-map-img-flock">

<!--3. Prototyping-->  
<h3>3. Prototyping</h3>
<p class="flock-body-p">I looked into what competitors were doing and what areas they hadn’t quite tapped. From there, I wrote out a flow of what path users would take within the app. Now, it was time to prototype!</p>
<!--Sketches-->  
<h4 class="subheading-beneath-process-stage">Sketches</h4>
<img src="Images/flock/flock sketches.png" alt="images of hand-drawn sketches of the splash, home and trip planning pages in the app" class="flock-body-images">
<!--Low-fi prototype-->  
<h4 class="subheading-beneath-process-stage">Low fidelity prototype</h4>
<img src="Images/flock/Flock low fi testing.png" alt="" class="flock-body-images">

<!--4.Testing-->  
<h3>4. Testing</h3>
<p class="flock-body-p">Due to COVID-19 limitations, I tested with five users over Zoom. While users enjoyed the overall idea of the app and its possible features, they had trouble visualizing what it would entail & wished for more consistency and details.</p>
<img src="Images/flock/user testing flock.png" alt="" id="user-testing-img">
<h4 class="subheading-beneath-process-stage">Key usability findings</h4>

<!--Key usability findings-->

    <li class="flock-usability-list">Fun, individualized profiles</li>
    <li class="flock-usability-list">"I would use this app."</li>
</ul>

<p class="flock-body-p">Taking users’ feedback into account, I expanded the detail to the itinerary, made it collapsable and added an area for additional activity tagging. I also expanded the chat feature and made it easier to locate additional chats in the high-fidelity prototype.</p>

<!--Future thoughts--> 
<h3>Reflections & future thoughts</h3>
<p class="flock-body-p">I’d love to build out the app’s functionality including an exploring feature where travelers could explore what their friends’ friends are doing, similar to Venmo’s feed. <br> <br> I'd also like to further expand the shared photo drive and conduct further testing.<br><br>Finally, it would be create to take this app into development!</p>
